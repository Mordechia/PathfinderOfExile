1. Plan out 2000 xp of encounters, and achievement rewards are plotted out
2. Dialog and information necessary for forward progression through the act.
3. Key beats/encounters planned out (Requires knowledge of the story and loreof PoE)
4. Treasure planned out https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581

Nice to have

1. Bits of lore( i.e.) weathered carvings that are found in the respective sections.
2. Lore created as handouts, not just text to be spoken by the GM
3. Magic items given out as treasure flavored to reference unique items/skills or start with a base item, give an additional/alternative ability to reference unique items/skills
