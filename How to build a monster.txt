If you find a comparable monster at appropriate level that already exists. Make equivalent exchanges of stats, and or special abilities.

If no such creature exists, look for one that can have the elite or weak template applied to it.

If that does not work, find one that does exist but is far outside the level range, figure out where the stats fall under terrible – extreme and use this calculator for figuring out what sort of stats it would have, add or subtract abilities depending on how large of a jump it is.
