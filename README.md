# PathfinderOfExile
Using the setting and storyline of Path of Exile to create a custom campaign using the pf2e ruleset

Long term goal is to have this be a 1 - 20 adventure across the 10 acts of path of exiles story. It is a long term goal and acts will be built out one at a time. 

I will be setting up the permissions for other people to contribute if they want, but final say on what gets added to the project/main branch falls to me.

This is NOT looking to add homebrew rules or mechanics based on mechanics of Path of Exile, at most will provide activated abilities to unique magic items, or special abilities of creatures as shout outs.
