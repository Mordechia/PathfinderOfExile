# PathfinderOfExile
Using the setting and storyline of Path of Exile to create a custom campaign using the pf2e ruleset

Long term goal is to have this be a 1 - 20 adventure across the 10 acts of path of exiles story. It is a long term goal and acts will be built out one at a time. I will be setting up the permissions for other people to contribute if they want, but final say on what gets added to the project/main branch falls to me
